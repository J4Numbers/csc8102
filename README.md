# CSC8102 System Security Coursework

By [Matthew D. Ball][1]

The following coursework is for the CSC8102 module in the Winter of 2016. The
module contains two deliverables for the coursework:

 1. Create an encryption/decryption program
 2. Crack a bunch of hashes

... I may be paraphrasing. Either way, those two parts directly corrolate to
the two branches and folders in this project - partone and parttwo. They make
use of the JCE policy override (available at [Oracle][2]) and everything
written within this repository is by myself unless explicitly stated in a
javadoc or in-line comment nearby any borrowed code.
